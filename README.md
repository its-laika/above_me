What is flying _above\_me_?

## Target
This projects listens to the APRS-servers of the OpenGliderNetwork and stores all incoming messages.
Via API you can then request the list gliders near a given position. 
The last step is a website (or app) which gets your position and returns the list of gliders right above you.
