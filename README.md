What is flying _above\_me_?

## Target
This projects listens to the APRS-servers of the [Open Glider Network](http://wiki.glidernet.org/) and stores all incoming messages.
Via API you can then request a list of gliders near a given position based on the OGN data. 
The final step is a website (or app) which automatically gets your position and returns the list of gliders right above you.
